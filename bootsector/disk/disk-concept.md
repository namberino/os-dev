# Components

- Platters
- Spindle
- Read/write heads
- Tracks 
- Sectors

# Platters

- Hard disk is organized to a concentric stack of disks
- A platter is an individual disk
- Each platter has a lower and an upper surface

# Spindle

- Platters are connected together by a spindle that runs through the middle

# Read/write heads

- Used to read and write data to each platter surface
- Can move back and forth along the surface of a platter
